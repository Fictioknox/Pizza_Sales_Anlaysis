 ## Tools Used:
 SQL for data analysis

 ## 1. 🎯 Purpose of the Analysis <br>
The goal of this analysis is to uncover key business insights from pizza sales. Through SQL queries, we’ve explored ordering patterns, popular pizza types, and customer preferences. Specifically, we aimed to:<br>
<br>

**Analyze order frequency based on time of day and day of the week.** <br>
**Understand revenue contributions from different pizza sizes (Small, Medium, Large).** <br>
**Uncover ordering trends that could help optimize the menu and improve operations.** <br>

## 2. 📋 Understanding the Data <br>
Our dataset is as rich as a cheesy pizza with all the right ingredients! It includes:<br>
<br>
Tables Overview:<br>
<br>
**Orders:** Captures each order’s date and time. <br>
**Order Details:** Contains information about each pizza ordered, including quantity and pizza type.<br>
**Pizza Types:** Describes each pizza’s name, category, and ingredients—everything from the spicy “Mexicana” to the savory “Chicken Alfredo.”*<br>
**Pizzas:** Lists each pizza’s size and price, helping us break down sales by size. <br>

**Handling Missing Values:** Some orders were incomplete (missing pizzas or quantities), which we either removed or filled with default values based on the context. <br>
**Data Cleaning:** We removed duplicates and incorrect entries, ensuring our analysis only used accurate and relevant data. <br>
